# UHC+

UHC+ is an alternate take on Minecraft’s **Ultra Hardcore** gamemode. Originally, it began as an add-on to [Cosmian UHC](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/cosmian-uhc-v3-1-18/), but has now branched off and become an independent project.

## What to expect:

- **A robust Augment system** in which players select a perk at the start of the game. There are 100+ augments and 3 different tiers of Augments, so there’s a lot of variety!
- **Gigantic Titans** that spawn throughout the game. Taking on these behemoths will net you great rewards!
- **Special items and equipment** that can be obtained through Augments or traversing through arduous structures. These items can do wonderous things...
- **Rising Lava** at the final stage of the game that will keep the competition hot.
- Automatic system that stops players from entering the Nether and moves players in the Nether back to the Overworld.
- **A grace period** system that stops players from attacking one another for a set time.
- An arrow count limit to stop players from lugging too many Arrows around.
- Classic UHC features like a shrinking world border, lack of natural regeneration, and permanent death.
- Highly configurable settings for the above features!
